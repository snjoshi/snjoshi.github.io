<span class="special">Hi, I'm Cassidy Williams!</span>
I'm a software engineer and developer evangelist at <a href="http://clarifai.com">Clarifai</a>.
I like it there.
<br><br>
I started my voyage into building for the great unknown (commonly referred to as
the World Wide Web) when I was an 8th grader in the suburbs of Chicago, and I've
been loving it ever since.
I'm primarily interested in front-end development, but hey, it's always fun to
try other things too.
<br><br>

I graduated in May 2014 from Iowa State University with my degree in computer
science and minor in Spanish. During my time there, I interned at several
companies, including Intuit, Microsoft, and General Mills. I was in charge of
the Computer Science/Software Engineering Club, among other things. I loved my
time at ISU. But now, I'm in New York, which is fun and different!
<br><br>

After school, I joined <a href="http://venmo.com">Venmo</a> in NYC, where I was
also a software engineer and developer evangelist.  While there, my work made
Venmo's API the <a href="http://studenthackers.devpost.com/">#1 payments API</a>
in the 2014-2015 hackathon season.  I joined Clarifai in August 2015, where I'm
working on building developer evangelism in the organization from the ground up.
I'm also doing some front-end engineering work, as their first female engineer!
Since moving to NYC, I've had the honor of working with various organizations,
such as <a href="http://hacker.fund/">Hacker Fund</a> as their Director of
Outreach, and I've been included as one of Glamour Magazine's
<a href="http://www.glamour.com/inspired/2014/09/top-new-women-leaders-in-technology/33">
  35 Women Under 35 Who Are Changing the Tech Industry</a> and in the
<a href="http://innotribe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-PowerWomen-in-FinTech-Index-Bridging-the-Gender-Gap.pdf">
Innotribe Power Women in FinTech Index</a>.  I've also had the pleasure of
working with Microsoft on the <a href="http://bigdreammovement.com">Big Dream
documentary</a> and the U.S.A. Science and Engineering Festival
<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/usasciencefestival/2014/09/24/cassidy-williams-an-emerging-computer-scientist-with-a-desire-to-inspire-more-women-in-stem/">
with their Nifty Fifty program</a> to encourage more students to participate in
STEM.
<br><br>

One of my favorite things to do is help people be successful, whether it means
mentoring them at a hackathon, editing their resume, or giving a talk. Check out
the <a href="#o1">Outreach section</a> to learn more about that. If you want.
<br><br>
I built this site from scratch, and you can stare at my source code in wonder
<a href="http://github.com/cassidoo/cassidoo-v3">here on my GitHub</a>.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about me or you just want to send me a funny gif
(pronounced with a soft G, I won't debate you on this), take a look at my
contact section below.

Thanks for reading this far. In exchange for your seemingly undying loyalty,
here is a joke: Why are mountains so funny?  Because they're hill areas.
